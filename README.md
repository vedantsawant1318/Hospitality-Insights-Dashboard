AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Insights
1) These hotel chains have a flat pricing strategy, due to which they are loosing potential revenue. Hence they should adopt a dynamic pricing strategy based on the demand-supply or atleast they should move on to weekend/weekday pricing model.
2) There is a very high correlation between the occupancy % and the average rating of a particular hotel, thus low occupancy % hotels should work on their online presence accross all platforms and also improve their in person services.
3) The rates at which they charge a customer from their own website or offline booking is higher than what they charge through other booking platforms. Thus they should lower their own channel prices as they don't have to pay any commision charges, in order to increase the revenue from their own channel.
